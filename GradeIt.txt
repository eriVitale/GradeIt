Project Description: Gradebook Portal for teachers to add and keep track of assignments and grades. Teachers can also add students to their roster by first and last name.

New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: Many to Many

Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2): Login/Registration, CRUD on Assignments
- 

Week 2 Features (to show at first office hour/lecture of Week 3): CRUD Students list
- ***Finish CSS work (could be Bootstrap or another framework too instead of CSS)***
- 

Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...):
- Add registration option for student account. Students can join teacher's roster by id, and teachers can add students by id.
- Add parent email functionality/auto alert for grades below 60%
- Add ability for teachers to create multiple class lists. The dashboard becomes a list of classes which, when selected, display that class's gradebook.
